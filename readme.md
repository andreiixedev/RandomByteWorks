# RandomByteWorks

**Programmable projects and ideas, created from everyday inspiration and curiosity.**  
A space where I experiment, build, and explore.

## 🌟 About

**RandomByteWorks** is the space where I experiment with various programming languages and create small programs for operating systems, including PPC and other architectures.

This repo (and possibly others under this organization) is less about polish and more about **experimentation** and **learning by doing**.
